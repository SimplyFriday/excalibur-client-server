# Client Server Game Template

This is a client/server game template using a node.js API and [Excalibur](https://excaliburjs.com) front-end. The front-end uses webpack so that it can be easily served in a browser, the back-end cannot be packed into a single file due to using worker_threads.

<!-- TODO: UPDATE ALL OF THIS CRAP
## Get Started

* Using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 14 (LTS) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* Run the `npm install` to install dependencies
* Run the `npm start` to run the development server to test out changes
   * [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) will build the [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) into Javascript
   * [Webpack dev server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) will host the script in a little server on http://localhost:8080/

## Publishing

* Run `npm run build:dev` to produce Javascript bundles for debugging in the `dist/` folder
* Run `npm run build:prod` to produce Javascript bundles for production (minified) in the `dist/` folder

The `dist/` folder can be deployed to a static web host. We recommend [Netlify](https://netlify.com) or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) since they are free to use.
